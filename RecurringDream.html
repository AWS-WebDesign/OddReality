<h1>facetiming my friend goes wrong</h1>
<body>
  <p>Just like every other night,after I return to my room,
  I facetime my friends. I called the first time and nobody picked
up. I tried calling the second time, still nobody answered.
Still not giving up, I called the third time. This time somebody
picked up. Instead of my friend's voice, all I heard was
screaming and a deep voice saying, "If you don't stop,
the next is you." <i>Opening my eyes, I took a deep breath.
It's already morning, my phone in my hand, I had once more
fallen asleep while facetiming my friend in Taiwan. (time zone difference) </i></p>
